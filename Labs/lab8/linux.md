# What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for various operating systems known as Linux distributions/)
# 3 Reasons to use Linux:
* Reason 1 (Users can view, modify, and distribute their own versions of the operating system.)
* Reason 2 (Linux provides a powerful command-line interface for system administration and configuration.)
* Reason 3 (The operating system has a strong permission model, and regular security updates are released to address vulnerabilities.)
